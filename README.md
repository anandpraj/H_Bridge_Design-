# H_Bridge_Design-
An H-bridge is a simple circuit that lets you control a DC motor to go backward or forward.  You normally use it with a microcontroller, such as an Arduino, to control motors.  When you can control two motors to go either forward or backward â€“ you can build yourself a robot!

Here I have designed a simple H-Bridge motor speed control circuit using KiCAD. The circuit consists of 2 pair of mosfets, 2 pair of resistors, two opto-isolators which can protect the microcontroller from sudden voltage spikes.
